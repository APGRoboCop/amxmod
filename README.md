AMX Mod (Not AMX Mod X/AMXX) OLO's original creation

First and foremost, credit goes to OLO for his dedication to the Half-Life community for the time and effort he put into coding for us. AMX is only one project among many that he is responsible for. Second to dJeyL who have hosted the AMX forum and current home for years now. His contributions to the Half-Life gaming community are many.

And third to KRoT@L who continued alone the development of the previous 2006.3 release before giving up (in the year 2006), that was so sad for the community and the most faithful of AMX Mod. But now several things have happenned since that, the domain has been given up, and it wasn't possible to make anything on the official website. But it has been taken back and the AMX Mod Team is back, to continue to the same project and to the same objectives that KRoT@L initiated. Wish us success!

But AMX Mod is in resurrection... wait & see!
